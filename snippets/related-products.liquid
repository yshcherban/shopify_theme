  Find a list of up to 4 related products for the `product` in the current context, and display
  them using the theme's `product.liquid` snippet.

  Related products could be sourced from one of 3 places, which are tried in order:

    1. A `theme.related_products` metafield on the product object, which is expected to contain
       a comma-separated list of related product handles.

    2. A collection with the handle `product-handle-related`, where `product-handle` is the handle
       of the current product.

    3. If neither of these are detected, the list of products is calculated manually by:

         (a) first, finding a "relevant" collection (defined as a collection the current product is
             in that isn't the `all` collection and that contains more than 4 products;

         (b) second, scoring each of the products in that collection by virtue of similarities in
             tags.

      Fall back to using products from a similar collection.
